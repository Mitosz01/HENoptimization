Hi!
This was one of my university projects when I was still undergraduate Bsc. The final version is uploaded as ~MAX_MINLP_LAST, I am no longer considering to do anything with it. There is a kind of manual to it, which unfortunately is written in hungarian, 
but the most of the project is derived from yee's work so you can look around there. I uploaded this work in the hope that this written MINLP modell in AIMMS will be somewhat useful for somebody in the long future. 
This code is totally free in the gplv2 sense! Happy coding <3!
